# Task 1: Secure Student Portal API
# Goal: Build a FastAPI API where students can log in to view their grades.
# Features:
# Student class with username, password (hashed), grades list
# POST /register/ to register students (store in students.json)
# POST /login/ to authenticate
# GET /grades/ â€” requires authentication via HTTP Basic or OAuth2 dependency
# Use try-except to handle file errors
# Commit changes to GitHub with descriptive messages
