# Task 3: Job Application Tracker (Relational DB + Search)
# Goal: Build a Job Application Tracker with SQLModel.
# Features:
# JobApplication model: company, position, status, date_applied.
# Each user can only access their own applications (auth required).
# Endpoints:
# POST /applications/ — add new job application.
# GET /applications/ — list all.
# GET /applications/search?status=pending.
# Use error handling for invalid queries.
# Use middleware to reject requests if User-Agent header is missing.
